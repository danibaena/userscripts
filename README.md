# Useful personal userscripts for Greasemonkey and Tampermonkey

I'll be collecting all my scripts in this repository, they're intended to work out of the box.

## Way to use:

Install Greasemonkey or Tampermonkey for Firefox/Chrome and add this scripts manually as a new userscript.

### Site: Amazon.es

* Amazon Wishlist Sum

    It sums both items and prices for that wishlist, only for the current page. It also counts not available items. It places the result underneath the last item in the wishlist.

    Example:
    ![amazon_wishlist_sum](http://i.imgur.com/obIYeKq.png)

* Coinc Amazon Discount Show

    It adds a new price next to the original showing how much a product would cost using the discount of 4% you can get with a Coinc bank account. There are certain items for which it's bugged for now, I'll try to fix it on the future. Any collaboration is welcome.
